	<h2> About... this </h2>
	<p> As mentioned, this website is part os my comp sci class at school. HTML is the last section we will be covering. Prior to this class, I had next to no experience with any programming, but I have taken apart a few computers. We started with scratch which was incredible simple. Next we used GVR which I feel would have been a nicer starting point, but I guess the class's structure has to accommodate a wide range of learning styles. After GVR, we started on python, which has been my favourite so far because of the freedom it has. I liked creating math formulae with python, one of which drew the spiral of Theodorus.</p>
