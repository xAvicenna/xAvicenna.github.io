	<p> I type on a KBC Poker ii with cherry MX blue switches. I ordered a set of Pulse SA keycaps from massdrop in early September and they are still yet to arrive (but I'm patiently waiting). The board itself is a little high up, so I made a wrist rest in my carpentry class. It turned out really well. I used padouk which is an African species and smells amazing when cut (a mix between rootbeer and vanilla) </p>
