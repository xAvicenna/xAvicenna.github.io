	<h1>Building PCs!</h1>
	
	<div class="combinedPara">
	<p>I've had a interest for PCs for a few years, but haven't kept up to date much because I never really had the means to become experienced in building. That changed a few months ago when I decided that it was time to drop some cash and build myself a decent CP for gaming, media, and school.</p>
	<p> Building was really fun dispite the issues I ran into along the way (namely a bad issue somewhere between the motherboard and CPU, but I'll discuss that alter) </p>
	<p> My rig has an Fx8320e CPU which admittedly is the only thing I would change if I were to revise my build. For my GPU, I got a beautiful Asus Strix 970, and for my case I went with a NZXT S340! The case is one of the nicest budget cases there is (even though at the time it cost me $100 with shipping) and has amazing cable management.  </p>
