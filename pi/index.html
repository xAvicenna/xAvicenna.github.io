	<h1> Pi is delicious </h1>
	<p> This section is the first paragraph. You can either force a new line by using a HTML tag, or you can force the text to loop to the next line in the browser by having too many characters/words for one line. Let's try and make that happen by typing out the digits of pi: three point one four one five nine two six five three five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six two six four three three eight three two seven nine five zero two eight eight four one nine seven one six nine three nine nine three seven five one zero. *gasps for air* five eight two zero nine seven four nine four four five nine two three zero seven eight one six four zero six two eight six two zero eight nine nine eight six two right zero three four eight two five three four two one one seven zero six seven nine. The first hundred digits should be suffice to push it to overflow a few lines. </p>
	<p> Digits 51 through 100 I re-memorised last week while working one night; it was a slow night. I don't know if it's my 'goal', but I'd like to memorise pi to 314 digits - because memorising to the Feynman point is a bit too much (762?)</p>
	
	<h2> Updates! </h2>
	<p>Last shift I had I managed to get another 40 digits memorised on top of the 100 previous ones. In addition to that, I have 27 more I memorised today (09/12/14).</p>
	<p> "Eight two one four eight zero eight six five one three two eight two three zero six six four seven zero nine three eight four four six zero nine five five zero five eight two two three one seven two five three five nine four zero eight one two eight one one one seven four seven zero two."</p>
	
	<h2> How did these values come to be? </h2>
	<p> It isn't my favourite equation or method to calculating pi, but I like the equation "4(4arctan(1/5)-arctan(1/239)) = Pi" because it looks so simple - unlike my favourite, which is the Chudnovsky algorithm: </p>

	<p> Unfortunatly, understanding what exactly that means is beyond my education so far (or at least understanding how applying it works).
